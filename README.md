## Abstract

Autonomous navigation in procedurally generated tunnels using a differential-drive robot equipped with LiDAR in Webots. Three controllers—(1) classical P (proportional), (2) GA-tuned P, and (3) neuroevolutionary MLP—are compared across a curriculum of increasing difficulty. The neuroevolutionary controller achieves the highest generalization and robustness across stages.
